        <article><p><strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong> is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.</p> 
          
          <p>CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version number.</p>

        <article>Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red: 
          <code>
            p {
              color: red;
              }
          </code>
          Let's try it out! Using a text editor, paste the three lines of CSS (above) into a new file. Save the file as <strong>style.css</strong> in a directory named styles.

To make the code work, we still need to apply this CSS (above) to your HTML document. Otherwise, the styling won't change the appearance of the HTML.
        <ol>
          <li>Open your <strong>index.html</strong> file. Paste the following line in the head (between the <head> and </head> tags): <code>&ltlink href="styles/style.css" 
      rel="stylesheet"/>
</code></li>
          <li>Save index.html and load it in your browser. If your paragraph text is red, congratulations! Your CSS is working.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</h3>
        Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand how it works: <br><br>
        <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/css-declaration-small.png" alt="css ruleset"> <br><br>

        The whole structure is called a <strong>ruleset</strong>. (The term ruleset is often referred to as just rule.) Note the names of the individual parts:
      <ul>
        <li class="blocks"><p><strong>Selector</strong><br>This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, &ltp> elements). To style a different element, change the selector.</p></li>
        <li class="blocks"><p><strong>Declaration</strong><br>This is a single rule like <code>color: red;</code>. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.</p></li>
        <li class="blocks"><p><strong>Properties</strong><br>These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, <em>color</em> is a property of the &ltp> elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.</p></li>
        <li class="blocks"><p><strong>Property Value</strong><br>To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the <em>property value</em>. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)</p></li>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(250,222, 140); display: inline; padding: 2px 10px;">Note the other important parts of the syntax:</p>
        <li style="list-style: disc;">Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})</li>
        <li style="list-style: disc;">Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
        <li style="list-style: disc;">Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one. ({})</li>
        <p>To modify multiple property values in one ruleset, write them separated by semicolons, like this: 
          <code>p {
  color: red;
  width: 500px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  }</code> You can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset to all of them. Separate multiple selectors by commas. For example:
          <code>p,
li,
h1 {
  color: red;
}</code> There are many different types of selectors. The examples above use element selectors, which select all elements of a given type. But we can make more specific selections as well. There are many more selectors to discover. To learn more, see the MDN <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors">Selectors guide</a>.
